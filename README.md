JavaScript Project (Interactive User Form)

In this interactive Form Project, I used some of the best techniques in real time, like Regular Expressions, Jquery, Unobtrusive, and Progressive Enhancement. And I used them to create all the validations for this project and make the Form interactive and user friendly. Some of those techniques throw error messages or valid messages to the user according to their inputs.
